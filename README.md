# Voice-controlled-Home-Automation

•	Implemented Internet of Things in the field of Home Automation where the user can control any electronic appliance by giving voice commands.

•	Used functionalities of Google Assistant, ESP8266 Wifi module, IFTTT and Adafruit IO as MQTT broker. The embedded code was written in Arduino IDE.

•	Google Assistant translates the speech of the user to text. IFTTT identifies relevant keywords and uploads the payload to the MQTT broker i.e., Adafruit IO in this case. The ESP module reads that payload and operates as programmed.

•	This project helped in understanding various “Internet of Things” concepts, design the components required for the flow of the basic IoT model and linking all those nodes together.
